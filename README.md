# Shellcode-Encoders
This repo contains different variety of encoders that I have written while learning malware development and obfuscation.\n
All the code is well commented for easy understanding.\n
All encoders are present in the Encoders folder.\n
For each Encoder, I have built a decoder/ stub builder which is in the Decoders folder.\n
All shellcodes are generic windows calc pop shellcodes built with msfevnom.\n
My Dev Env: \n
   *MS Visual Studio
   *Windows 10 x64
   *Msfvenom for generating shellcodes
