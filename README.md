# Shellcode-Encoders
This repo contains a different variety of encoders that I have written while learning malware development and obfuscation.
All the code is well commented for easy understanding.
All encoders are present in the Encoders folder.
For each Encoder, I have built a decoder/ stub builder which is in the Decoders folder.
All shellcodes are generic windows calc pop shellcodes built with msfevnom.
My Dev Env: 
   *MS Visual Studio
   *Windows 10 x64
   *Msfvenom for generating shellcodes
